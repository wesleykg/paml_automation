paml_automation
===============

Work in progress.

Creating a Makefile that will automate testing for evidence of selection using PAML

What I want to do:

Input a fasta file
Convert it to phylip
Convert it to PAML special phylip
Run paml test (maybe have one command for test 2, and one for test 1, and one command for both)
Read results into csv or tsv (or .xlsx)
Analyze results using R (check if test was succesful)
Write results to file
