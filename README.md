===============

Work in progress.

Creating a Makefile that will automate testing for evidence of selection using PAML

###Completed features:###

Input a fasta file with any name and convert it into a phylip file suitable for use in PAML

###Features to be added:###

Run paml test (maybe have one command for test 2, and one for test 1, and one command for both)
Read results into csv or tsv (or .xlsx)
Analyze results using R (check if test was positive or negative)
Write results to file
